Plasticity, phenotypic diversity and phenotypic selection are elements that are found in this series of simulation and that evoke the  multi level selection evolution described in~\citep{jablonka2014evolution}. Among the three tested fluctuations, the LF and SF simulations are showing the most similarities with this model. In ScF simulation most successful evolutionary strategy seems to include small genotypes maybe to maximize the phenotypic impact of mutations. Nevertheless this series of simulation does not precisely determine whether the duration of environnemental cycles or the number of different types of environment is the main criterion to explain the differences between LF and SF one side and ScF the other side, further investigation would be an interesting extension of this work.
