One distinguishes \emph{Strong and Light fluctuations} from \emph{Short-Cycle fluctuations}. These two groups diverge substantially in their characteristic and differ in addition from \emph{Stable Environment}, frequently in between. Individuals from \emph{Short-Cycle fluctuations} seem to produce stable and robust phenotypes in any environment encountered in \emph{Short-Cycle fluctuations}. Their adaptations seem essentially be by genotypic mutations and their plasticity seems low. They are also very dependent on their original ecosystem and consequently very little robust in other types of fluctuations, the effect of genotypic mutations is probably enhanced by the reduced size of genotypes. By contrast individuals evolved with \emph{Strong or Light fluctuations} appear to have a considerable plasticity, their phenotypic diversity is high and it seems likely that phenotypic selection occurs however their genotypic diversity is lower.
