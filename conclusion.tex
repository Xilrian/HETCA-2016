Plasticity, phenotypic diversity and phenotypic selection are elements that are found in this series of simulation and evoke the  multi level selection evolution described in~\citep{jablonka2014evolution}. The \emph{light and strongs fluctuation} simulations seem to be those which show the most similarities with this model. Nevertheless this series of simulation does not precisely determine whether the duration of environemental cycles or the number of different types of environment is the main criterion to explain the differences between \emph{light and strongs fluctuation} and \emph{Short-Cycle fluctuation} and this would be interesting to study in a future work.
