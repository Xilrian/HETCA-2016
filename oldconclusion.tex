Plasticity, phenotypic diversity and phenotypic selection are elements that are found in this series of simulation and evoke the  multi level selection evolution described in~\citep{jablonka2014evolution}. Among the three tested fluctuations, the \emph{light and strongs fluctuation} simulations are showing the most similarities with this model. In \emph{Short-Cycle fluctuation} simulation most successful evolutionary strategy seems to include small genotypes maybe to maximize the phenotypic impact of mutations. Nevertheless this series of simulation does not precisely determine whether the duration of environnemental cycles or the number of different types of environment is the main criterion to explain the differences between \emph{light and strongs fluctuation} and \emph{Short-Cycle fluctuation} and this would be interesting to study in a future work.
