%In~\citep{lipson2002origin} Lipson demonstrated a correlation between the modularity and the rate of change of the environment resources. While in \citep{yu2007program} Yu used observed that populations exploit neutrality to cope with environmental fluctuations and therefore evolve some sort of evolvability under two alternating objective functions. Both of these simulations used Genetic Programming~(GP) and employed explicit fitness functions.
