Review 4

The authors seek to show that their system and experimental conditions conform with the model of plasticity set out in Jablonka et al. (2014). Specifically, Jablonka contends that changing environments create pressures that would select for phenotypic plasticity. Crucially, the authors make an assumption that their new measure of phenotypic proximity (\sigma(t_1,t_2)) relates to plasticity. Specifically, “If environmental changes lead to selection of plasticity… then phenotypes from different individuals of the same lineage observed while environmental conditions are similar should be relatively close [as measured by \sigma] even though individuals from their lineage evolved [through] other environmental conditions between these measure[ment]s.” Little effort is made to validate \sigma, and little evidence is presented that phenotypic proximity is a valid measure of plasticity or epigenetic adaptation. Either work validating \sigma should be presented (possibly by objectively measuring plasticity of a genotype in different environments and relating this measure to \sigma), or this claim should be removed.

Other Specific Concerns:
- Introduction - No particular definition of plasticity, or how plasticity would present in HetCA is ever given.
DAVID => virer la notion de plasticity et mettre mutli-level selection


- Under “HetCA”, a figure describing the life-cycle of a cell would be well taken. As it is, understanding the relationship between living, decay, and quiescent cell states took several re-readings, and referring to Medernach (2013) to puzzle out, as did the variability of the length of decay. This section should be edited or re-written.
- Under “Experimental Setup”, the second paragraph describes the transitions of cell states, and *very briefly* describes the probability of propagation of a cell. This probability is crucial to the functioning of the system, particularly to the fluctuating selection mechanism. A figure, or some explanatory text would be useful here.
DAVID =>  definir plus clairement le genetic transfer (un paragraph) 
SIMON ET RENEE => A voir si les modification rendent effectivment plus clair, sinon reecrire qqchose? ,
DAVID => En dernier recourt : faire des figures qui de toute façon ne rentrerons pas.

- The rationale for performing the Homogenous Tests on the MCG is never explicitly given. One can infer from careful reading that the claims of multi-level selection are intended to be backed up by the results of the homogenous tests, specifically by implying that without the surrounding sets of cells with their own co-evolved sets of rules, plasticity or epigenetic mutation would not be possible. However, this claim is never actually made, and thus cannot be evaluated. Either this claim should be made explicit, or the multi-level selection reference should be removed.
=> premier point 

- The print on figures 2-7 had small, but mostly readable legend text. However, the text of figures 8, 9, and 10 were so small as to be unreadable. These figures should be re-generated with a larger font.
DAVID =>  figure 2-7 et 9, 10 : Agrandir les fonts
SIMON =>  figure 8 :Agrandir les fonts 


- The figure captions were excessively brief, essentially only titles. A more helpful caption would walk the reader through what they are seeing.
SIMON => rajouter des fonts

- All figures should include statistical information of significance claims, so that the reader can evaluate claims being made.
DAVID => Rajouter une frase pour dire median et comment error bar sont calculé (et voir ou integrer, ie. dans le text et/ou dans a legende)

Review 2

"You would have to reconstruct the community..." I suggest moving the rest of the paragraph to the discussion and conclusion section.
SIMON => check si bien mais a priori ok

I was wondering about the relative size of the genome - (1) is it long enough to be expressive enough (2) you report the overall genomic characteristics as a definition of diversity, but did you do any qualitative assessment of the genomes, is there an emergence of coding vs. non-coding regions especially in context of different environments.
DAVID => footnote pour dire qu'on a calculer les resulter et que ça marche

I felt you left me hanging at the discussion.
- how your findings stack against behavioral biologists such as Peter and Rosemary Grant's work on speciation as a precursor for genetic diversity.
- is almost seems like some of your work might support their observations.
- small genotypes make sense, so how about the spatial trait propagation that would lead to diversity

Review 1

My first question at this point is “why?” What additional understanding of environmental fluctuations in real evolution will this produce?

This paper would be stronger if the introduction stated a hypothesis (about the role of environmental fluctuations) that the model described was being used to test. Models are great, but they are not (or should not) be ends in themselves. The ultimate test of whether a model is worth pursuing (for scientific purposes at least) is how well it can be used to address a question about the real world.

Your aim is expressed more clearly at the end of the methodology, where you state that you “anticipate that the existence of frequent environmental fluctuations will promote phenotypic selection over genotypic selection.”
DAVID => Peut-etre deja repondu en intro

I’d encourage you to use this eminently valid question about real evolution, which your model is well-suited to address, to set up the motivation for your paper. Ultimately, your experiments don’t provide a strong answer to this question. This is fine, though should indicate a direction for further exploration, either of scenario- or model-space.

Several of the sections in your Results and Analysis launch into a description of *what* you did. It would be helpful to provide the reader with context about *why* you are reporting this particular result/analysis.
DAVID ET SIMON => voir comment faire quelque chose de consistent  : clairement poser une  hypothese claire en introduction (et au passage virer ce qui se raporte a la palsticité) et y faire refeence tout au long de l'article)



This paper contains some very long sentences. For example, the first sentence of the Phenotypic Comparison section on page 3 comes in at around 60 words. Leave this to Henry James: shorter sentences are easier to read.
RENE => VERIFIER

Figures 11 and 12 were (on my screen) very indistinct. Would a lower resolution image (ie, a smaller region of the CA) illustrate the differences you discuss more clearly?
DAVID => A voir
