\begin{abstract}
The importance of environmental fluctuations in the evolution by natural selection of living beings has been widely noted by biologists and linked to many important characteristics of life such as: modularity, plasticity, genotype size, mutation rate, and learning or epigenetic adaptations. However, in artificial life simulations, environmental fluctuations are usually seen as a problem to be solved rather than an essential characteristic of evolution. We propose in this paper to use HetCAis, a heterogeneous cellular automata characterized by its ability to generate open ended long-term evolution and evolutionary progress, to measure the impact of different forms of environmental fluctuations. Our results indicate that environmental fluctuations induce mechanisms analogous to epigenetic adaptations in HetCA.
