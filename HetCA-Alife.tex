\begin{abstract}
The importance of environmental fluctuations in the evolution by natural selection of living organisms has been widely noted by biologists and linked to many important characteristics of life such as: modularity, plasticity, genotype size, mutation rate, learning or epigenetic adaptations. In artificial life simulations, however, environmental fluctuations are usually seen as a nuisance rather than an essential characteristic of evolution. HetCA is a heterogeneous cellular automata characterized by its ability to generate open-ended long-term evolution and ``evolutionary progress''. In this paper, we propose to measure the impact of different types of environmental fluctuations in HetCA. Our results indicate that environmental changes induce mechanisms analogous to epigenetic adaptation or multilevel selection. This is particularly prevalent in two of the tested fluctuation schemes, which involve a round-robin inhibition of certain cell types, where a phenotypic selection seems to occur.
